Each module includes detailed descriptions of content, prerequisites, learning outcomes, and assessment methods. Topics covered include cryptography, database systems, machine learning, and web data integration. Students are expected to engage in lectures, exercises, and projects to deepen their understanding and practical skills in the field of business informatics. The program aims to develop students' abilities in problem-solving, abstraction, information system deployment, scientific interpretation, teamwork, application of knowledge in a team context, mediation between technical and non-technical individuals, and independent problem-solving in business informatics. Students also have the potential to continue their studies at the PhD level.\n",

The alternate examination dates are before the following lecture period begins or at the latest during the first weeks. There should be at least three weeks between announcing results from the examinations taken on the regular dates and the alternate examination dates. The alternate examination dates count for the semester in which the regular dates occurred. For supervised, written examinations, the regular examination dates are also at the start of the semester break, and the alternate examination dates are before the following lecture period begins or at the latest during the first week. The same three-week gap between announcing results applies, and the alternate examination dates also count for the semester in which the regular dates occurred.
