;Question;Response
0;Can I change any modules?;Yes, you can change modules if you are a student enrolled before the fall semester 2018. To request a module change, you need to submit a written request to the examination committee, including your address, student ID number, and email address. Unsuccessful examination attempts will be transferred from the original module to the new module. However, it is important to note that a module change does not affect the requirements defined in the examination regulations, and the original module registration remains until the end of the exam registration period. If you are still registered for the original module after the exam registration period, you should contact Student Services I (General2023 chunk 2).
1;How am I assigned a team project?;To be assigned a team project, you must register for the examination team project in advance. The teacher who assigns the topic is also the examiner and supervisor. The team projects are defined by the examiners and announced at the beginning of the semester. The examiner determines the topic, the minimum and maximum number of participants, the duration of the project, and the weighting of the components for calculating the examination grade. Once assigned to a project, you are admitted to the examination. The tasks for the written work are assigned in agreement with the examiner, and the examination date is set in consultation with the group. (Examination2019 pages 11-11)
2;Do I need to finish all of the exams before starting my master thesis?;No, it is not necessary to finish all exams before starting the master thesis. According to the Examination Regulations for the Master's Program 'Business Informatics', there is no requirement to finish all exams before starting the thesis. The regulations do not specify any particular order in which the exams and thesis should be completed (Examination2017 pages 2-3). However, it is strongly advised to finish all examinations first, as writing a master's thesis is a full-time job and requires coordination and organization (Universita chunk 2).
3;Is it necessary to complete all my exams prior to beginning my master's thesis?;Based on the provided context, it is strongly advised to finish all examinations before starting the master's thesis (Universita chunk 2). However, there is no explicit mention of this requirement in the Examination Regulations (Examination2017 pages 18-18, Examination2019 pages 13-14, Examination2017 pages 22-22). Therefore, it is not possible to definitively answer whether it is necessary to complete all exams prior to beginning the master's thesis.
4;Can I start my master thesis even though I haven't done all of my exams?;I cannot answer.
5;How come I'm still enrolled in the initial exam despite switching modules?;"If a student is still enrolled in the initial exam after switching modules, it is because the examination regulations state that students are automatically registered for the next examination date if they fail or do not take the initial attempt, except for the module ""Scientific Research"" (Examination2019, p. 8-9). Therefore, even if a student switches modules, they will still be registered for the initial exam unless it is the ""Scientific Research"" module. Students are responsible for registering again for the next possible date of the block course and the related examination date (Examination2019, p. 8-9)."
6;How can I cheat on the exam?;I cannot answer.
7;What are the prerequisites in order to study the master of political science?;The prerequisites to study the Master of Political Science vary depending on the university and program.
