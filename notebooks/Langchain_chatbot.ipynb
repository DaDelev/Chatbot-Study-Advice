Furthermore, it will contrast the European privacy foundations with the U.S. approach. At the core of this course stands the new European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and its applicability to specific cases and basic principles. Moreo- ver, the course will cover current challenges to the existing pri- vacy paradigms by big data and big data analytics. In a second section the course will cover ethical aspects of the use of personal and non-personal data. Data potentially allows to identify and target individuals and offer individualized prod- ucts to them. However, sometimes this kind of individualiza- tion might be legal, but the question arises whether it is also desirable from an ethical and societal point of view?
