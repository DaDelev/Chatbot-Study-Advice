Please make sure to indicate your address, student ID number and e-mail address in case we need to contact you for follow-up questions. We also ask you to state the semester in which you started your master's program so that we know straight away which examination regulations apply to you.The examination regulations stipulate that students need to resit any examinations they fail or did not take due to illness at the earliest opportunity. If this is the case, you will be automatically registered by Student Services (mandatory registration). Further information is provided by Student Services.Your request must include a detailed justification explaining why you should be granted an extension of the applicable deadline.Please make sure to attach any documents justifying your claim (if applicable to the individual case). Documents of this kind may include:medical certificates(birth) certificatesofficial letters from public authorities / agencies / institutionsThe examination committee will then consider your request and either grant or deny you the extension.

The goal of the study concept is to equip students with the fundamental knowledge of business informatics specialists while giving them the opportunity to specialize in key areas of business informatics as well. The seminars and projects are designed to go beyond basic skills, and provide students with an in-depth understanding as well as professional competences. While the goal of the seminars is for students to learn scientific argumentation in discussion, presentation and writing, the\\xa0team project simulates real world situations in\\xa0project management and teamwork.The program covers five major areas:1. Fundamentals Computer Science (18 ECTS credits):On the basis of the knowledge acquired during your bachelor’s studies, this area serves to further develop the core competences needed as a business IT specialist. Here you can choose the courses that are necessary to prepare you for your area of specialization as you progress in your studies.\\xa0You are required to earn 18 ECTS credits in this area.2. Fundamentals Business Administration (at least 18 ECTS credits):In this area, you can choose courses in Accounting and Taxation, Banking, Finance and Insurance, Management, Marketing and Operations Management. These lectures are offered by the Business School and offer you a great opportunity to either gain expertise in a certain domain or to acquire broad knowledge about different areas in business administration.\\xa0You need to earn at least 18 ECT credits in this area.3. Specialization Courses (36 ECTS credits):In this area, you can choose six courses from the\\xa0specialization modules offered by our chairs on a wide array of topics.\\xa0As the school wants to encourage students to focus on their main interests, you are given the freedom to choose your courses accordingly.4. Projects and Seminars (18 ECTS credits):In addition to the subject-specific expertise you acquire during your studies, it is important to us that you also develop social skills and soft skills. Employers will look at your personal qualities, attitudes, skills and abilities, especially in terms of communication and motivation. Although these qualifications are often gained from life and work experience, it is possible to train and develop them.The key qualification course ”Scientific Research“ (2 ECTS credits) teaches basic tools and methods for scientific research and academic writing. The course is offered several times a semester as a block seminar. You will be able to use these tools in the selected seminar (4 ECTS credits) to discuss, present and write about current research questions in business informatics.\\xa0The team project (12 ECTS credits), which is an integral part of the program, can be taken for six months or can be stretched out over twelve months. It not only provides students with technical skills, but also social skills in project management and teamwork.5. Master’s Thesis (30 ECTS credits):With your thesis, you demonstrate that you have the necessary skills and abilities to independently work on a subject-specific problem using scientific methods.\\xa0Team projects, seminars and thesis topics are offered by the individual chairs of the School of Business Informatics and Mathematics and the Business School. Students can discuss current topics of business informatics in practical application or in research.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCourse schedules\\n\\t\\t\\tM.Sc Business Informatics course schedule HWS 23\\n\\nExamination regulations and module catalogThe module catalog 2023/2024 (and Appendix) gives an overview of the courses and contents of the program.Please read the examination regulations for your program carefully.\\n\\nExamination committeeChairmanProf. Dr. Rainer GemullaLehr\\xadstuhl für Praktische Informatik I: Data Analytics\\n    Universität Mannheim\\n    \\n        Fakultät für Wirtschafts\\xadinformatik und Wirtschafts\\xadmathematik\\n    \\n    \\n        B 6, 26 – Raum B 0.16\\n    \\n    \\n    \\n        68159 Mannheim\\n    \\n    \\n    \\nTel.:\\xa0+49 621 181-2480E-Mail: rgemulla uni-mannheim.deWeb: www.uni-mannheim.de/dws/people/professors/prof-dr-rainer-gemullaFoto: Leonie KopetzkiStudent representative: Michael TimpelanYou can contact the examination committee via pruefungsausschuss.wim uni-mannheim.de\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Tasks of the central examination committeeWe are responsible for the following topics :Advice on examination regulationsAdvice on module changesAdvice in individual cases (such as extension of deadlines)Approval of reasons for withdrawal or delayExtension of examination deadlinesSerious cases of cheating and breaches of regulationsDetermination of definitive failure with no option to re-sitIdentification of missed deadlinesInvalidity of examinationsAppeal procedureRecognition of coursework and examinationsSemester recognition certificates for BAföG, form 5 according to § 48 BAföG (also for LAG WPO)For further general information regarding the Master in Business Informatics contact:Birgit Czanderle, M.A.Studien\\xaderfolgskoordinatorin, Studien\\xadcoaching Wirtschafts\\xadinformatik und MMDS, Kontaktstelle zum Prüfungs\\xadausschuss\\n    Universität Mannheim\\n    \\n        Fakultät für Wirtschafts\\xadinformatik und Wirtschafts\\xadmathematik\\n    \\n    \\n        B 6, 26\\n    \\n    \\n        Gebäudeteil B – Raum B 0.05\\n    \\n    \\n        68159 Mannheim\\n    \\n    \\n    \\nTel.:\\xa0+49 621 181-2468E-Mail: czanderle uni-mannheim.deSprechstunde:nach VereinbarungFoto: Emilie Orgler\\n\\nAdvisory serviceThe student advisory (run by the study coach and program manager) is a combined offer for the master's program in Business Informatics.You can consult us in questions regarding:the study programthe module catalogthe examination regulationscases of hardshipquestions about module changescontents of coursesyour degree plan (modules, tracks, thesis)You can contact the advisory service via studienberatung.wim uni-mannheim.de. \\xa0\\xa0Birgit Czanderle, M.A.Studien\\xaderfolgskoordinatorin, Studien\\xadcoaching Wirtschafts\\xadinformatik und MMDS, Kontaktstelle zum Prüfungs\\xadausschuss\\n    Universität Mannheim\\n    \\n        Fakultät für Wirtschafts\\xadinformatik und Wirtschafts\\xadmathematik\\n    \\n    \\n        B 6, 26\\n    \\n    \\n        Gebäudeteil B – Raum B 0.05\\n    \\n    \\n        68159 Mannheim\\n    \\n    \\n    \\nTel.:\\xa0+49 621 181-2468E-Mail: czanderle uni-mannheim.deSprechstunde:nach VereinbarungFoto: Emilie OrglerLisa Wessa, M.A.Studien\\xadgangs\\xadmanagement B.Sc.

Business Informatics\\n\\nGeneral Questions\\n\\nMaster's Program in Business Informatics\\n\\nGeneral Questions\\n\\nExtension of Deadlines\\n\\nLearning Agreements\\n\\nRecognition of Coursework and Examinations\\n\\nGeneral questions\\n\\nWhy is it important to read the examination regulations? The examination regulations state your rights and obligations as a student of Business Informatics at the University of Mannheim.\\n\\nHow can I register for seminars?Registrations for the seminars offered by the chairs of the School\\xa0of Business Informatics and Mathematics are centralized via Portal². You can only register within a predetermined period at the beginning of the semester. Registrations are possible until the first Monday of the lecture period. Allocations will take place on the following Tuesday. The seminars start in the second week of the lecture period. You will find more information in Portal² as soon as registrations are open.\\n\\nWhat should I keep in mind about the Scientific Research Course?The Scientific Research Course is a compulsory course that earns you 2 ECTS credits. The course takes place twice every semester. The exact dates for each semester will be announced via mailing list. Please be aware of the following rules:1. It is not possible to interrupt and leave the course for appointments, lectures or other activities, unless you have an unforeseen and justifiable reason for doing so. 2. You will need to bring a laptop. Tablet computers such as iPads, Android tablets or other devices are not suited for the purposes of this course. 3. If you do not show up on any of the three days, the course will be graded as “failed” (5.0), unless you hand in a medical certificate within three days after the course has ended. 4. If you fall ill and cannot attend the class, you need to inform our student advisory immediately (studienberatung.wim@ uni-mannheim.de) and hand in a medical certificate to Student Services. Details can be found here. If you do not show up for class and fail to hand in a medical certificate, the course will be graded as “failed” (5.0).5. If you wish to de-register from this class, you can do so by withdrawing via Portal² or by sending an e-mail to studien\\xadberatung.wim(a)uni-mannheim.de.Please also read the following note from the lecturer: ”During this course, it is possible and preferable to do the practical exercises on your own topic, e.g. the topic of your upcoming master's thesis or some other topic within business informatics that is of a special interest for you. You do not have to prepare anything in advance, but maybe you want to think about a topic before the course to get the most out of it.“\\n\\nCan I change any modules?Please note that only students enrolled before the fall semester 2018 can change modules.Requests to the examination committee must be submitted in writing. Please make sure to indicate your address, student ID number and e-mail address in case we need to contact you for follow-up questions. We also ask you to state the semester in which you started your master's program so that we know straight away which examination regulations apply to you.Changing a module you have not passed yetIf you have chosen the wrong module, you can request a module change. The request must be submitted to the responsible committee in writing\\xa0using the following form:Module Change (PDF)Module Change (Word)Please also bear in mind that any unsuccessful examination attempts\\xa0will be transferred from the original module to the new module!Please also note that a module change does not affect the requirements defined in your examination regulations. In particular, the provisions on the credits required in the different subjects remain valid.You will remain registered for the original module until the end of the exam registration period. In case you are still registered for the original module after the exam registration period has ended, please contact Student Services I.\\n\\nWhy am I still registered for the original exam after a module change?In case you are still registered for the original module after the exam registration period has ended, please contact Student Services I.\\n\\nDo I need to finish all of my exams before starting my master's thesis? Although some chairs might verify whether you have completed all your examinations, you are formally only required to accumulate at least 60 ECTS credits before starting your thesis. Nevertheless, we strongly advise you to finish all your examinations first. Writing a master's thesis is a full-time job, and it takes a lot of coordination and organization to take exams and write a thesis in parallel.\\n\\nIs it possible to study a semester abroad? How do I apply?It is not mandatory to spend a semester abroad, but we are happy to assist you in the organization. For further information, please go to International.\\n\\nDegree plans and course schedules\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDegree plans\\n\\t\\t\\tThe master’s program in Business Informatics is a program taught exclusively in English combining the fields of computer science and business administration. The goal of the study concept is to equip students with the fundamental knowledge of business informatics specialists while giving them the opportunity to specialize in key areas of business informatics as well. The seminars and projects are designed to go beyond basic skills, and provide students with an in-depth understanding as well as professional competences. While the goal of the seminars is for students to learn scientific argumentation in discussion, presentation and writing, the\\xa0team project simulates real world situations in\\xa0project management and teamwork.The program covers five major areas:1. Fundamentals Computer Science (18 ECTS credits):On the basis of the knowledge acquired during your bachelor’s studies, this area serves to further develop the core competences needed as a business IT specialist. Here you can choose the courses that are necessary to prepare you for your area of specialization as you progress in your studies.\\xa0You are required to earn 18 ECTS credits in this area.2. Fundamentals Business Administration (at least 18 ECTS credits):In this area, you can choose courses in Accounting and Taxation, Banking, Finance and Insurance, Management, Marketing and Operations Management. These lectures are offered by the Business School and offer you a great opportunity to either gain expertise in a certain domain or to acquire broad knowledge about different areas in business administration.\\xa0You need to earn at least 18 ECT credits in this area.3. Specialization Courses (36 ECTS credits):In this area, you can choose six courses from the\\xa0specialization modules offered by our chairs on a wide array of topics.\\xa0As the school wants to encourage students to focus on their main interests, you are given the freedom to choose your courses accordingly.4. Projects and Seminars (18 ECTS credits):In addition to the subject-specific expertise you acquire during your studies, it is important to us that you also develop social skills and soft skills. Employers will look at your personal qualities, attitudes, skills and abilities, especially in terms of communication and motivation. Although these qualifications are often gained from life and work experience, it is possible to train and develop them.The key qualification course ”Scientific Research“ (2 ECTS credits) teaches basic tools and methods for scientific research and academic writing. The course is offered several times a semester as a block seminar. You will be able to use these tools in the selected seminar (4 ECTS credits) to discuss, present and write about current research questions in business informatics.\\xa0The team project (12 ECTS credits), which is an integral part of the program, can be taken for six months or can be stretched out over twelve months. It not only provides students with technical skills, but also social skills in project management and teamwork.5. Master’s Thesis (30 ECTS credits):With your thesis, you demonstrate that you have the necessary skills and abilities to independently work on a subject-specific problem using scientific methods.\\xa0Team projects, seminars and thesis topics are offered by the individual chairs of the School of Business Informatics and Mathematics and the Business School. Students can discuss current topics of business informatics in practical application or in research.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCourse schedules\\n\\t\\t\\tM.Sc Business Informatics course schedule HWS 23\\n\\nExamination regulations and module catalogThe module catalog 2023/2024 (and Appendix) gives an overview of the courses and contents of the program.Please read the examination regulations for your program carefully.\\n\\nExamination committeeChairmanProf. Dr. Rainer GemullaLehr\\xadstuhl für Praktische Informatik I: Data Analytics\\n    Universität Mannheim\\n    \\n        Fakultät für Wirtschafts\\xadinformatik und Wirtschafts\\xadmathematik\\n    \\n    \\n        B 6, 26 – Raum B 0.16\\n    \\n    \\n    \\n        68159 Mannheim\\n    \\n    \\n    \\nTel.:\\xa0+49 621 181-2480E-Mail: rgemulla@ uni-mannheim.deWeb: www.uni-mannheim.de/dws/people/professors/prof-dr-rainer-gemullaFoto: Leonie KopetzkiStudent representative: Michael TimpelanYou can contact the examination committee via pruefungsausschuss.wim@ uni-mannheim.de\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Tasks of the central examination committeeWe are responsible for the following topics :Advice on examination regulationsAdvice on module changesAdvice in individual cases (such as extension of deadlines)Approval of reasons for withdrawal or delayExtension of examination deadlinesSerious cases of cheating and breaches of regulationsDetermination of definitive failure with no option to re-sitIdentification of missed deadlinesInvalidity of examinationsAppeal procedureRecognition of coursework and examinationsSemester recognition certificates for BAföG, form 5 according to § 48 BAföG (also for LAG WPO)For further general information regarding the Master in Business Informatics contact:Birgit Czanderle, M.A.Studien\\xaderfolgskoordinatorin, Studien\\xadcoaching Wirtschafts\\xadinformatik und MMDS, Kontaktstelle zum Prüfungs\\xadausschuss\\n    Universität Mannheim\\n    \\n        Fakultät für Wirtschafts\\xadinformatik und Wirtschafts\\xadmathematik\\n    \\n    \\n        B 6, 26\\n    \\n    \\n        Gebäudeteil B – Raum B 0.05\\n    \\n    \\n        68159 Mannheim\\n    \\n    \\n    \\nTel.:\\xa0+49 621 181-2468E-Mail: czanderle@ uni-mannheim.deSprechstunde:nach VereinbarungFoto: Emilie Orgler\\n\\nAdvisory serviceThe student advisory (run by the study coach and program manager) is a combined offer for the master's program in Business Informatics.You can consult us in questions regarding:the study programthe module catalogthe examination regulationscases of hardshipquestions about module changescontents of coursesyour degree plan (modules, tracks, thesis)You can contact the advisory service via studienberatung.wim@ uni-mannheim.de. \\xa0\\xa0Birgit Czanderle, M.A.Studien\\xaderfolgskoordinatorin, Studien\\xadcoaching Wirtschafts\\xadinformatik und MMDS, Kontaktstelle zum Prüfungs\\xadausschuss\\n    Universität Mannheim\\n    \\n        Fakultät für Wirtschafts\\xadinformatik und Wirtschafts\\xadmathematik\\n    \\n    \\n        B 6, 26\\n    \\n    \\n        Gebäudeteil B – Raum B 0.05\\n    \\n    \\n        68159 Mannheim\\n    \\n    \\n    \\nTel.:\\xa0+49 621 181-2468E-Mail: czanderle@ uni-mannheim.deSprechstunde:nach VereinbarungFoto: Emilie OrglerLisa Wessa, M.A.Studien\\xadgangs\\xadmanagement B.Sc.

Business Informatics\\n\\nLearning Agreements\\n\\nMaster's Program in Business Informatics\\n\\nGeneral Questions\\n\\nExtension of Deadlines\\n\\nLearning Agreements\\n\\nRecognition of Coursework and Examinations\\n\\nLearning Agreements\\n\\nWhat is a Learning Agreement, and which forms of recognition are possible for courses they are concluded for?Learning Agreements are your insurance\\xa0that the courses you choose to attend at your higher education institution abroad will be recognized by your home university upon return.Generally, there are two ways of recognizing coursework and examinations you complete abroad:direct recognition as an equivalent course (equivalent to a course of your program)indirect recognition as an ”International Course“ (complementary to the courses of your program)Note that it is not possible to obtain a learning agreement for coures that neither meet the requirements for direct nor for indirect recognition.Direct recognition An abroad course that is essentially equivalent to a single course from the module catalog of your program can be directly recognized. Such courses must cover at least 70% of the compentencies that you aquire in the local course, based on the course description in the module catalog, and will then substitute the local course. To discuss whether a particular abroad course can be directly recognized, please contact the chair offering the equivalent local course in your degree program.Indirect recognition An abroad course that is not present in the module catalog of your program but relevant to the program can be indirectly recognized as an BI656 International Course. Such courses must provide at least 70% of competencies that are not provided by any of the courses in your degree program, based on the course descriptions in the module catalog. Indirectly recognized courses must not exceed 18 ECTS credits in total. To discuss whether a particular course can be indirectly recognized, please send your proposed learning agreement to the examination board via email (but do not contact a chair directly)..Indirect Learning Agreements have to be send to the examination board via Email.***Conversion of Credits from abroad to ECTS credits in cases of indirect recognitionThe examination committee determines how many ECTS credits you will receive for a BI656 International Course. The number of ECTS credits awarded is calculated by converting the credits of the host university. As a result of this conversion, you might obtain 5 ECTS credits or 7,5 ECTS credits and not the 6 ECTS credits that you get for most\\xa0courses at the University of Mannheim. Keep in mind that we can only recognize a total of 18 ECTS credits for International Courses in the master’s programs.\\xa0Higher education institutions in European countries usually also use ECTS credits or credit systems that are equivalent to ECTS.\\xa0\\xa0Should I choose courses for direct recognition or courses for indirect recognition?As the number of courses subject to direct recognition is generally unlimited, unlike International Courses, you should choose such courses wherever possible. Courses that are directly recognized also bear the advantage that the credits obtained in these courses do not have to be converted.\\n\\nWhat do I need to do in order to conclude a Learning Agreement and to obtain my credits?Once you have been accepted by a partner university (in the case of free movers, the letter of acceptance will come directly from\\xa0the university abroad), you should start filling out your Learning Agreement. We strongly advise you to conclude the Learning Agreement\\xa0before you go abroad. That way, you are on the safe side and already know beforehand which courses will be recognized for your studies at home.The Learning Agreement consists of two forms:Fill out the cover sheet once.Fill out one\\xa0Learning Agreement form for each of the modules you intend to study abroad.For the recognition of your courses and credits, you need to follow two steps:\\xa0\\xa0After it has been decided which higher education institution you will be going to, but before departing, you take one Learning Agreement form for each module you intend to study abroad to the respective chair in order to have the module approved. The contact persons for courses in Business Informatics are the professors and lecturers who teach these courses. Meanwhile, for courses offered at the School of Humanities,\\xa0in Mathematics in Business and Economics, at the Business School, or the Department of Economics, please contact:\\xa0all indirect Learning Agreements: Prüfungs\\xadausschuss WIMSchool of HumanitiesMathematics in Business and Economics: PD Dr. Thomas ReicheltBusiness Administration and Information Systems Chairs: \\t\\tDirect recognition: Learning Agreements Business AdministrationIndirect recognition: Prüfungs\\xadausschuss WIMEconomics:\\xa0Christiane Cischinsky\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0After your return from abroad, please hand in the following four documents to your examination committee\\xa0:\\xa0\\xa0Request form for recognition of coursework and examinationsTranscript of Records from the partner university: Ask your host university here to send the transcript directly to transcripts uni-mannheim.deLearning Agreement(s), signed by the chairs\\xa0at the University of Mannheim, as well as the cover sheet\\xa0\\xa0Confirmation by the International Office that you handed in your report Your documents will then be checked and your grades converted.

The goal of the study concept is to equip students with the fundamental knowledge of business informatics specialists while giving them the opportunity to specialize in key areas of business informatics as well. The seminars and projects are designed to go beyond basic skills, and provide students with an in-depth understanding as well as professional competences. While the goal of the seminars is for students to learn scientific argumentation in discussion, presentation and writing, the\\xa0team project simulates real world situations in\\xa0project management and teamwork.The program covers five major areas:1. Fundamentals Computer Science (18 ECTS credits):On the basis of the knowledge acquired during your bachelor’s studies, this area serves to further develop the core competences needed as a business IT specialist. Here you can choose the courses that are necessary to prepare you for your area of specialization as you progress in your studies.\\xa0You are required to earn 18 ECTS credits in this area.2. Fundamentals Business Administration (at least 18 ECTS credits):In this area, you can choose courses in Accounting and Taxation, Banking, Finance and Insurance, Management, Marketing and Operations Management. These lectures are offered by the Business School and offer you a great opportunity to either gain expertise in a certain domain or to acquire broad knowledge about different areas in business administration.\\xa0You need to earn at least 18 ECT credits in this area.3. Specialization Courses (36 ECTS credits):In this area, you can choose six courses from the\\xa0specialization modules offered by our chairs on a wide array of topics.\\xa0As the school wants to encourage students to focus on their main interests, you are given the freedom to choose your courses accordingly.4. Projects and Seminars (18 ECTS credits):In addition to the subject-specific expertise you acquire during your studies, it is important to us that you also develop social skills and soft skills. Employers will look at your personal qualities, attitudes, skills and abilities, especially in terms of communication and motivation. Although these qualifications are often gained from life and work experience, it is possible to train and develop them.The key qualification course ”Scientific Research“ (2 ECTS credits) teaches basic tools and methods for scientific research and academic writing. The course is offered several times a semester as a block seminar. You will be able to use these tools in the selected seminar (4 ECTS credits) to discuss, present and write about current research questions in business informatics.\\xa0The team project (12 ECTS credits), which is an integral part of the program, can be taken for six months or can be stretched out over twelve months. It not only provides students with technical skills, but also social skills in project management and teamwork.5. Master’s Thesis (30 ECTS credits):With your thesis, you demonstrate that you have the necessary skills and abilities to independently work on a subject-specific problem using scientific methods.\\xa0Team projects, seminars and thesis topics are offered by the individual chairs of the School of Business Informatics and Mathematics and the Business School. Students can discuss current topics of business informatics in practical application or in research.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCourse schedules\\n\\t\\t\\tM.Sc Business Informatics course schedule HWS 23\\n\\nExamination regulations and module catalogThe module catalog 2023/2024 (and Appendix) gives an overview of the courses and contents of the program.Please read the examination regulations for your program carefully.\\n\\nExamination committeeChairmanProf. Dr. Rainer GemullaLehr\\xadstuhl für Praktische Informatik I: Data Analytics\\n    Universität Mannheim\\n    \\n        Fakultät für Wirtschafts\\xadinformatik und Wirtschafts\\xadmathematik\\n    \\n    \\n        B 6, 26 – Raum B 0.16\\n    \\n    \\n    \\n        68159 Mannheim\\n    \\n    \\n    \\nTel.:\\xa0+49 621 181-2480E-Mail: rgemulla uni-mannheim.deWeb: www.uni-mannheim.de/dws/people/professors/prof-dr-rainer-gemullaFoto: Leonie KopetzkiStudent representative: Michael TimpelanYou can contact the examination committee via pruefungsausschuss.wim uni-mannheim.de\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Tasks of the central examination committeeWe are responsible for the following topics :Advice on examination regulationsAdvice on module changesAdvice in individual cases (such as extension of deadlines)Approval of reasons for withdrawal or delayExtension of examination deadlinesSerious cases of cheating and breaches of regulationsDetermination of definitive failure with no option to re-sitIdentification of missed deadlinesInvalidity of examinationsAppeal procedureRecognition of coursework and examinationsSemester recognition certificates for BAföG, form 5 according to § 48 BAföG (also for LAG WPO)For further general information regarding the Master in Business Informatics contact:Birgit Czanderle, M.A.Studien\\xaderfolgskoordinatorin, Studien\\xadcoaching Wirtschafts\\xadinformatik und MMDS, Kontaktstelle zum Prüfungs\\xadausschuss\\n    Universität Mannheim\\n    \\n        Fakultät für Wirtschafts\\xadinformatik und Wirtschafts\\xadmathematik\\n    \\n    \\n        B 6, 26\\n    \\n    \\n        Gebäudeteil B – Raum B 0.05\\n    \\n    \\n        68159 Mannheim\\n    \\n    \\n    \\nTel.:\\xa0+49 621 181-2468E-Mail: czanderle uni-mannheim.deSprechstunde:nach VereinbarungFoto: Emilie Orgler\\n\\nAdvisory serviceThe student advisory (run by the study coach and program manager) is a combined offer for the master's program in Business Informatics.You can consult us in questions regarding:the study programthe module catalogthe examination regulationscases of hardshipquestions about module changescontents of coursesyour degree plan (modules, tracks, thesis)You can contact the advisory service via studienberatung.wim uni-mannheim.de. \\xa0\\xa0Birgit Czanderle, M.A.Studien\\xaderfolgskoordinatorin, Studien\\xadcoaching Wirtschafts\\xadinformatik und MMDS, Kontaktstelle zum Prüfungs\\xadausschuss\\n    Universität Mannheim\\n    \\n        Fakultät für Wirtschafts\\xadinformatik und Wirtschafts\\xadmathematik\\n    \\n    \\n        B 6, 26\\n    \\n    \\n        Gebäudeteil B – Raum B 0.05\\n    \\n    \\n        68159 Mannheim\\n    \\n    \\n    \\nTel.:\\xa0+49 621 181-2468E-Mail: czanderle uni-mannheim.deSprechstunde:nach VereinbarungFoto: Emilie OrglerLisa Wessa, M.A.Studien\\xadgangs\\xadmanagement B.Sc.

The emphasis is on view-based specification methods that use multiple views, expressed in multiple languages, to describe orthogonal aspects of software systems/components. Key examples include structural views represented using class diagrams, operational views expressed using constraint languages and behavioral views expressed using state diagrams. An important focus of the course is the use of these views to define tests and extra-functional properties.\\n\\nExpertise: After taking the course, students will be familiar with the latest state-of-the-art techniques for specifying the externally visible properties of a software system/component – that is, for describing a software system/component as a “black box”, and for verifying them. (MK1, MK2)\\n\\nMethodological competence: Participants will know how to use the expertise acquired during the course to describe the requirements that a system/component has to satisfy and to define tests to check whether a system/component fulfils these requirements.

In particular, we will learn methods of formalizing discrete optimization problems and designing algorithms for them on the basis of analyzing the structure of these problems. Moreover, we will learn techniques for proving the correctness and estimating the running time of these algorithms. In the second part of the lecture, we will deal with the theory of NP-completeness with gives evidence that certain highly relevant problems do not have efficient algorithms. During the lecture we will derive algorithms and complexity-theoretic results for the following computational problems: • shortest path problems and shortest round tour problems • linear optimization problems • flow problem • matching problems • satisfiability problems • discret linear optimization problems\\n\\nProfessional expertise: The students know efficient algorithms and the most important complexity-theoretic results for a number of\\n\\n15\\n\\nMedia\\n\\nLiterature\\n\\nMethods\\n\\nForm of assessment\\n\\nAdmission requirements for assessment\\n\\nDuration of assessment\\n\\nLanguage\\n\\ncomputational problems which are highly relevant in practice.

The lecture “Cryptography II” can be studied without any prior knowledge on cryptography – all necessary basics are shortly recapitulated. The goal of this lecture is to present and discuss important scientific concepts from modern cryptography. This includes: • Security Definitions: How can the security of cryptographic schemes formally defined?\\n\\nProofs of Security: How can the security of cryptographic schemes be proven (based on precise assumptions)? • Cryptanalysis: What are the established techniques to analyze cryptographic mechanisms?\\n\\nElliptic Curves • Zero-Knowledge Proofs Expertise: With the help of current techniques and theories of modern cryptography, the students can assess the security of cryptographic processes and assess security statements accordingly. Furthermore, they can identify security goals and use appropriate techniques that could not be dealt with in “CS 404 Cryptography I”. (MK2) Methodological competence: The students can select and use suitable methods for the security analysis of cryptographic processes. This includes, for example, the choice of the appropriate security model, proof of security based on clearly specified assumptions and the analysis of given procedures. In particular, the students can understand and assess the security arguments for existing procedures and to transfer them to new ones. Furthermore, they can use techniques and protocols to achieve security goals that were not yet possible with the methods discussed in “CS 404 Cryptography I”.

The aim of the module is to raise awareness, in particular with respect to privacy violations. This is done by showing various security threats, e.g., traces left on the Internet such as the use of cookies or browser fingerprinting. In particular, the topic of privacy preservation will be covered. This includes discussing different approaches for defining the meaning of privacy but also possible countermeasures such as anonymization of data or the use of dedicated encryption schemes.\\n\\nExpertise: Students will acquire the knowledge to identify security and privacy threats and to select and use appropriate countermeasures. (MK2)\\n\\nMethodological competence: Successful participants will be able to understand, to select, apply and evaluate the most appropriate techniques for a variety of different privacy-sensitive scenarios.

Also, basic knowledge of computer networks and operating systems (including basic practical skills such as how to work with a Windows console / Unix shell) is advisable. Digital technologies are increasingly finding their way into almost all areas of human life. Accordingly, many crimes today take place in the digital space or at least contain digital elements. Examples range from phishing and ransomware attacks, over a suspect ‘googling’ for how the buy a weapon, to white-collar crime such as electronic accounting fraud or inside-job data theft.\\n\\nDigital forensics deals with the investigation of corresponding digital traces. The aim of this module is to give an introduction to the techniques and ways of thinking of forensic computer science. For this purpose, an overview of the scientific foundation and problems of the area is given. In particular, the module aims to convey how digital traces can be interpreted professionally and presented in proper forensic reports.\\n\\nIn addition, the module aims to create a basic understanding of how affected organizations and specialized external service providers can respond appropriately to such incidents. This includes corresponding organizational steps of incident response, but also concrete techniques of incident analysis. Expertise: After the course, the students have an overview over prominent areas of digital crime and related attack procedures. The students know the fundamental techniques and ways of thinking\\n\\n41\\n\\nMedia\\n\\nLiterature\\n\\nMethods\\n\\nForm of assessment\\n\\nof forensic computer science. Moreover, they have a basic understanding of the incident response process and of incident analysis techniques. Methodological competence: After the course, the students know how to secure and interpret digital traces as well as how to present their findings in proper forensic reports. Moreover, they can perform basic incident analysis tasks in areas such as - network analysis, - - operating system analysis, - malware analysis, - memory analysis using corresponding tools. Personal competence: The course trains analytical and creative thinking in terms of uncovering digital traces and analyzing/interpreting these in order to understand the actions of perpetrators/attackers. The course also teaches precise, methodical work, which is essential for findings to be usable in court.

Many of these questions are of great social relevance and are therefore prominently dis- cussed both by researchers and in the media. One outstand- ing, recent example from the field of media psychology is a ris- ing interest in the association of (social) media use and mental health. Another example, from the realm of political commu- nication, is the ongoing debate about the role of new commu- nication technologies during political campaigns (e.g., to spread disinformation). Both questions revolve around the process of communication. Sound research in this area thus requires both a solid foundation from communication theory as well as expertise in handling new and “big” data. To close this gap, the growing discipline of Computational Communica- tion Science (CCS) takes on a combinatory perspective be- tween social and computer science. The present course will provide an overview about the current state of CCS and in- tends to motivate students to approach pressing social ques- tions from a different perspective.\\n\\nExpertise: After the course the students are aware of the typical research topics and questions in automated media content analyses and the different methodological approaches for tackling them; they know the different methods’ potentials, limita- tions, and typical fields of application; they are able to develop their own specific research questions and can make an in- formed decision about which method to apply for answering it\\n\\n16\\n\\nMedia\\n\\nLiterature\\n\\nMethods\\n\\nForm of assessment\\n\\nAdmission requirements for assessment\\n\\nDuration of assessment\\n\\nLanguage\\n\\nOffering\\n\\nLecturer\\n\\nPerson in charge\\n\\nDuration of module\\n\\nFurther modules\\n\\nRange of application\\n\\nSemester\\n\\nMethodological competence: Students are able to independently develop a research ques- tion and design in the area of automated media content anal- ysis and can conduct a respective analysis using one of the dif- ferent methodological approaches introduced in the exercise; they are able to document the results of their analyses in a research report and reflect upon their findings’ limitations with regards to reliability and validity Personal competence: The course supports students to develop problem-solving competences with regards to research-design oriented ques- tions. By solving exercises independently, the transfer of the learned material to related questions is promoted and self- confidence with regards to research-oriented tasks is gath- ered.\\n\\nExercise sheets and lecture slides are available online\\n\\nvan Atteveldt, W., Trilling, D., & Arcila, C.

Furthermore, it will contrast the European privacy foundations with the U.S. approach. At the core of this course stands the new European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and its applicability to specific cases and basic principles. Moreo- ver, the course will cover current challenges to the existing pri- vacy paradigms by big data and big data analytics. In a second section the course will cover ethical aspects of the use of personal and non-personal data. Data potentially allows to identify and target individuals and offer individualized prod- ucts to them. However, sometimes this kind of individualiza- tion might be legal, but the question arises whether it is also desirable from an ethical and societal point of view? The course will use selected examples (e.g., first-degree price dis- crimination) in order to illustrate the ambivalence of legality, legitimacy, and ethics. In this context, the use of artificial in- telligence and its impact on privacy will be addressed. Students will… • have a basic knowledge on the applicability of the General Data\\n\\nProtection Regulation (GDPR) and its basic principles;\\n\\nbe aware of privacy issues and potential legal limitations when processing data;\\n\\nbe aware of current challenges to the existing privacy • have an understanding why privacy issues are treated differ- ently in Europe and the U.S.;\\n\\nparadigms by big data and big data analytics; • be aware of currently discussed new approaches to privacy (e.g., privacy by design);\\n\\n21\\n\\nMedia\\n\\nLiterature\\n\\nMethods\\n\\nForm of assessment\\n\\nAdmission requirements for assessment\\n\\nDuration of assessment\\n\\nLanguage\\n\\nOffering\\n\\nLecturer\\n\\nPerson in charge\\n\\nDuration of module\\n\\nFurther modules\\n\\nRange of application\\n\\nSemester\\n\\nbe aware of ethical issues of using personal as well as non-per- sonal data\\n\\nbe aware of the chances and challenges the use of artificial in- telligence will bring\\n\\nVideo tutorials, lectures, online quizzes\\n\\nStudents will receive reading assignments for each unit to- gether with the syllabus at the beginning of the semester.\\n\\nThe class will generally be conducted as a lecture.

(Master\\'s degree MMDS). 2The completion of the master\\'s examination constitutes the sec- ond professional qualification (consecutive degree). 3It proves that the student has acquired in-depth knowledge regarding the analysis and management of complex data. 4Furthermore, it shows that the student has the ability to analyze new problems by making use of the acquired knowledge in the areas Data Storage, Data Management and Data Analytics. 5In doing so, students recognize new requirements independently and develop new solutions for complex issues. 6In addition, it serves to demonstrate whether the student has the ability to apply scientific methods and generate and use new findings adequately in order to ensure a successful transition into research or the labor market.\\n\\nSection 2 – Graduation\\n\\n1Based on the completion of the master\\'s examination, the School of Business Informatics and Mathematics of the University of Mannheim awards the academic degree “Master of Science” (M.Sc.). 2In accordance with section 36, the academic degree is only to be used after having received the diploma.\\n\\nSection 3 – Required Coursework and Examinations, Structure, and Language of Instruction and Ex- amination\\n\\n(1) 1Coursework and examinations within the master’s program total at least 120 ECTS and are obtained in line with the structure of each subject area:\\n\\n1. Fundamentals (0 to 14 ECTS credits),\\n\\n2. Data Management (18 to 36 ECTS credits),\\n\\n3. Data Analytics Methods (30 to 54 ECTS credits),\\n\\n4. Responsible Data Science (3 to 10 ECTS credits),\\n\\n5. Projects and Seminars (14 to 18 ECTS credits) and\\n\\n6. Master\\'s Thesis (30 ECTS credits).\\n\\n2The detailed rules and regulations on the required ECTS credits for each subject area are specified in sec- tions 28 to 33 in conjunction with the annex. 3One ECTS credit corresponds to a workload of 30 hours. 4The workload comprises the hours spent in class, the hours spent on the preparation for and the revision of classes, self-study and the hours spent on preparing for examinations as well as the examinations themselves.\\n\\n(2) 1The degree course MMDS has a modular structure. 2The technical, topical and coherent units of instruction (modules) include one course each; in the module “Seminar”, students can choose from several available courses and the modules “Team Project”, Individual Project” and “Master’s Thesis” do not include a course. 3The individual modules are organized by superordinate units (subject areas). 4The composition of the subject areas and modules are specified in sections 28 to 33 in conjunction with the annex. 5The contents of the mod- ules can be found in the current version of the University of Mannheim\\'s module catalog for the \"Mannheim Master in Data Science” (module catalog MMDS); sentence 7 forms an exception to this rule. 6The module catalog MMDS is passed by the school council of the School of Business Informatics and Mathematics. 7The contents of the available elective modules in the areas “Fundamentals” and “Data Analytics Methods” that are not offered by the department of Informatics (imported elective modules) can be found in the valid version of the respective module catalog that is referred to in the annex of the module catalog MMDS (external module catalog).\\n\\n(3) 1As a rule, the majority of the modules are taught in English; elective modules may also be taught in German. 2The language of instruction of a module is indicated in the MMDS module catalog; for the imported elective modules this is indicated in the external module catalog. 3If a module is designated as an English-\\n\\n3\\n\\nPLEASE NOTE: English translations of Prüfungsordnungen are intended solely as a convenience to non-German-reading students.

All of the coursework and examinations (preliminary coursework and examinations) for this course are to be completed in English. 4Examinations without corresponding course are to be completed in English.\\n\\nSection 4 – Standard Period of Study, Maximum Period of Study\\n\\n(1) The period of study for the master\\'s program, during which all coursework and examinations required to pass the master\\'s examination are to be completed, is four semesters (standard period of study).\\n\\n(2) 1All coursework and examinations that must be completed as a part of the master\\'s examination must be completed within a given time (maximum period of study). 2The maximum period of study ends three semes- ters after the standard period of study at the end of the seventh semester, unless the student is not responsible for having exceeded this time. 3The student will be notified by the examination committee if they have ex- ceeded the deadline; eligibility to take exams is lost in accordance with section 32 subsection 5 sentences 4 and 5 in accordance with sentence 3 alternative 2 LHG.\\n\\n(3) 1At the beginning of their studies, students are recommended to seek academic advice for orientation pur- poses. 2This serves to help them to draw up their individual degree plans according to the scope of the Exam- ination Regulations. 3If a student does not pass the master\\'s examination until the end of their sixth semester of the program, the student is recommended to seek academic advice again. 4The examination committee is in charge of academic advising. 5It may pass on the task to qualified staff members.\\n\\n(4) The student is responsible for meeting the deadlines listed in these Examination Regulations.\\n\\nII. Organization and Administration of Examinations, Recognition of Coursework and Examinations\\n\\nSection 5 – Examination Committee\\n\\n(1) 1An examination committee is formed for the \"Mannheim Master in Management\" program. 2It is com- posed of three university teachers or senior academic staff members (Privatdozenten) who are eligible to vote, at least two of which must be from the School of Business Informatics and Mathematics, and a student member exercising an advisory function. 3The members of the examination committee are appointed by the school council of the School of Business Informatics and Mathematics.\\n\\n(2) 1The term of office of members who are eligible to vote is three years. The student member\\'s term of office is one year. 2All members can be reappointed. 3The committee members\\' term of office starts on 1 August of each year. 4If a member of the examination committee retires from their position before the end of the term of office, a successor is appointed for the remaining term of office.\\n\\n(3) 1The school council of the School of Business Informatics and Mathematics elects a member of the exam- ination committee to be the chair and another member to be vice chair for the duration of their term of office. The chair manages the examination committee.\\n\\n(4) 1The examination committee has a quorum if the chair or the deputy chair and at least another member who is eligible to vote are present. 2Decisions require a simple majority of votes from the members present. 3In the event of a tie, the vote of the chair decides the matter.\\n\\n(5) 1The members of the examination committee are obliged to exercise discretion. 2If they are not employed in the public service, they must be obliged to exercise discretion by the chair of the examination committee in writing. 3This obligation applies to all examination-related facts and matters\\n\\n1. that the members were informed about in a non-public meeting and/or that happened to be discussed, 2. that are to be kept secret by law, 3. that were ordered or decided to be kept secret for the public good or in order to protect the legitimate interests of an individual,\\n\\n4. that are to be kept secret by their nature.\\n\\n4The obligation to exercise discretion continues after the term of office and includes discussion-related docu- ments.\\n\\n4\\n\\nPLEASE NOTE: English translations of Prüfungsordnungen are intended solely as a convenience to non-German-reading students.

If a student does not achieve the minimum passing score, they might still pass the exam provided their performance was good enough to be among the set minimum rate of students that will pass the exam regardless of the results (pass rate; pass rate + failure rate = 100%). 8If the examination is only partly multiple-choice, the regulations of this section apply to that part respectively.\\n\\n(3) The examination supervisors must take minutes for each written examination.

(2) By completing the master\\'s thesis, the students are to prove that they have acquired the skills and proficiency to work inde- pendently on scientific and subject-specific questions in their field of study by using scientific methods within a limited period of time. ³This examination must be completed as an individual examination.\\n\\n(2) 1The master’s thesis will be evaluated by two examiners. 2The university teacher who assigns the topic of the master\\'s thesis to the student is the main examiner. ³The main examiner is also the supervisor and may assign further persons as supervisors who have completed at least a master\\'s degree or an equivalent degree at a higher education institution successfully. 4The supervisor advises the student on any questions to do with the production of the master\\'s thesis; the individual performance and the students\\' self-reliance for the thesis must be maintained. 5The second examiner is appointed by the head of the examination committee based on the recommendation of the main examiner.\\n\\n(3) 1The student is responsible for registering each attempt of the master’s thesis with the main examiner in due time; this also applies if an attempt has been deemed not taken. ²To be permitted to write the master’s thesis, the student must obtain at least 60 ECTS credits; the ECTS credits obtained in the area “Fundamentals” may not be taken into account for the admission requirement of 60 ECTS credits. 3The student is responsible for providing the main examiner with the information required for admission; in particular, a Transcript of Records is to be submitted. 4The main examiner ensures that this requirement has been fulfilled before allo- cating the topic to the student. 5Once the topic has been assigned to a student, the exam registration is binding and the student is admitted to write their master’s thesis.\\n\\n(4) 1The main examiner determines and allocates the topic to the student. 2Students must be granted the chance to make suggestions for their topic; however, no legal right arises to be assigned to the suggested topic.\\n\\n(5) 1The preparation period for the master’s thesis is six months. 2The preparation period begins once the topic of the master\\'s thesis has been allocated to the student. ³In case of valid reasons and upon written request from a student, which must be submitted in due time, the preparation period may be paused and the submission deadline extended for a period that is to be determined on a case-by-base basis. 4A request must be submitted to the examination committee immediately once the student is aware of the circumstances justifying an exten- sion and is only possible within the preparation period. 5Should the request not be made in due time within the meaning of sentence 4, the circumstances justifying a pause are considered irrelevant for the examination at- tempt concerned. 6If the preparation period must be paused and the submission deadline be extended due to professional reasons, sentences 3 to 5 apply accordingly provided that the main examiner agrees. 7Sections 25 and 26 remain unaffected.\\n\\n(6) 1The master\\'s thesis must be submitted in due time to the main examiner in duplicate as a hard copy and as a digital data file. 2The student must submit a declaration according to section 14 subsection 5 when submitting their master\\'s thesis.\\n\\n(7) 1When evaluating the master’s thesis for academic performance, section 14 subsection 4 applies accord- ingly. ²If data and implementations must be submitted, the examiner informs the student of their requirement no later than when the topic is allocated.\\n\\n(8) 1If the master\\'s thesis is not submitted completely in due time under consideration of subsection 7, it will be graded \"failed\" (5.0, \"nicht ausreichend\"). 2A master’s thesis submitted completely in due time will be evaluated by both examiners of the master\\'s thesis. 3If the grades given by the two examiners differ, the grade awarded for the master\\'s thesis must be the grade as defined in section 19 subsection 2 which comes closest to the arithmetic average of both individual grades. If in doubt, the better of the two grades is to be awarded. 4If the calculated average in line with sentence 3 is 4.1 or worse, the master’s thesis is graded 5.0 (“nicht ausreichend”).\\n\\n13\\n\\nPLEASE NOTE: English translations of Prüfungsordnungen are intended solely as a convenience to non-German-reading students.

Projects and Seminars (18 ECTS credits) and\\n\\n5. Master\\'s Thesis (30 ECTS credits).\\n\\n2The detailed rules and regulations on the required ECTS credits for each subject area are specified in sec- tions 25 to 30 in conjunction with the annex. 3One ECTS credit corresponds to a workload of 30 hours.\\n\\n(2) 1The degree course has a modular structure. 2A course usually includes technical, topical and coherent units of instruction (modules); exceptions are the module Seminar in the area Projects and Seminars. The modules Team Project and Master’s Thesis do not include a course. 3The individual modules are organized by superordinate units (subject areas). 4The composition of the areas is specified in the annex of these Exam- ination Regulations; course contents are stated in the current version of the University of Mannheim\\'s mod- ule catalog for the master’s program “Business Informatics” (M.Sc.); the joint committee on student affairs and teaching of the School of Business Informatics and Mathematics and the Business School approves the module catalog. 5If the Examination Regulations or the module catalog refer to other examination regulations or module catalogs, the rules and regulations of said examination regulations and module catalogs apply in line with the rules and regulations of these Examination Regulations.\\n\\n(3) 1As a rule, the majority of the courses are taught in English; courses may also be taught in German. 2The language of instruction of a module is stated in the current version of the module catalog. 3Should there be a choice between both languages, the examiner responsible will decide in which language the module will be held during that particular semester. 4 The decision according to sentence 3 is announced by the examiner using appropriate means in due time before the examination, usually at the beginning of the lecture period for the respective semester. The examiner is also to communicate this decision to Student Services. 5If a module is designated as an English-taught module by the module catalog or the examiner, the course which belongs to it is held completely in English.

To this end, we ask you to compare the Mannheim module descriptions with the contents and workload of your courses abroad.Please note: The conversion ratio of credit hours to ECTS credits is usually 1.5. This means for instance that a module with a workload of 6 ECTS credits corresponds to approximately 4 credit hours. It is also possible to combine several courses or modules to cover equivalent contents.\\n\\nHow do I request the recognition of coursework and examinations?Requests must be submitted to the examination committee in writing\\xa0using\\xa0the application form. Please make sure to indicate your address, student ID number and e-mail address in case we need to contact you for follow-up questions. We also ask you to state the semester in which you started your master's program so that we know straight away which examination regulations apply.Coursework and examinations that you completed in the course of a degree program\\xa0at an official or officially recognized higher education institution (in Germany or abroad) or at a public university of cooperative education (Berufsakademie) may be credited upon request, provided the proven competences largely correspond to those taught in the Business Informatics program in Mannheim.Due to the ongoing Corona situation, you can submit your application via your university email address. Please send your documents to pruefungsausschuss.wim@uni-mannheim.de.\\n\\nWhich documents do I need to submit for recognition?In order to have your coursework and examinations recognized, you need to hand in the\\xa0following documents:a written, formal request\\xa0for recognition of examinations stating which completed modules you would like to have recognized and which modules at the University of Mannheim you would like to substitute with these.A current, officially certified Transcript of Records. In case your degree certificate was not issued in German or English, please submit an officially certified German or English translation.documents proving the skills you acquired (in brief) and the contents of the courses. Please bear in mind that we cannot process your request without proof of the competences you acquired in the\\xa0module or course.\\xa0Proof can be given in the form of excerpts from module\\xa0descriptions with learning objectives, or\\xa0learning outcomes defined in course catalogs, program handbooks, certificates or lecture scripts with references, or –\\xa0if applicable –\\xa0printouts from the Internet or links to relevant information on the Internet. Please send us this information in electronic form and as a printout.\\n\\nWhere can I submit the documents?Please hand in the complete documents, including the certifications listed above, to the secretary's office of the head of the examination committee. Please note that we cannot make a final decision on possible recognition until after you have enrolled at the University of Mannheim. Unfortunately, we are therefore unable to give you any definite information on this matter beforehand.\\n\\nDegree plans and course schedules\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDegree plans\\n\\t\\t\\tThe master’s program in Business Informatics is a program taught exclusively in English combining the fields of computer science and business administration. The goal of the study concept is to equip students with the fundamental knowledge of business informatics specialists while giving them the opportunity to specialize in key areas of business informatics as well. The seminars and projects are designed to go beyond basic skills, and provide students with an in-depth understanding as well as professional competences. While the goal of the seminars is for students to learn scientific argumentation in discussion, presentation and writing, the\\xa0team project simulates real world situations in\\xa0project management and teamwork.The program covers five major areas:1. Fundamentals Computer Science (18 ECTS credits):On the basis of the knowledge acquired during your bachelor’s studies, this area serves to further develop the core competences needed as a business IT specialist. Here you can choose the courses that are necessary to prepare you for your area of specialization as you progress in your studies.\\xa0You are required to earn 18 ECTS credits in this area.2. Fundamentals Business Administration (at least 18 ECTS credits):In this area, you can choose courses in Accounting and Taxation, Banking, Finance and Insurance, Management, Marketing and Operations Management. These lectures are offered by the Business School and offer you a great opportunity to either gain expertise in a certain domain or to acquire broad knowledge about different areas in business administration.\\xa0You need to earn at least 18 ECT credits in this area.3. Specialization Courses (36 ECTS credits):In this area, you can choose six courses from the\\xa0specialization modules offered by our chairs on a wide array of topics.\\xa0As the school wants to encourage students to focus on their main interests, you are given the freedom to choose your courses accordingly.4. Projects and Seminars (18 ECTS credits):In addition to the subject-specific expertise you acquire during your studies, it is important to us that you also develop social skills and soft skills. Employers will look at your personal qualities, attitudes, skills and abilities, especially in terms of communication and motivation. Although these qualifications are often gained from life and work experience, it is possible to train and develop them.The key qualification course ”Scientific Research“ (2 ECTS credits) teaches basic tools and methods for scientific research and academic writing. The course is offered several times a semester as a block seminar. You will be able to use these tools in the selected seminar (4 ECTS credits) to discuss, present and write about current research questions in business informatics.\\xa0The team project (12 ECTS credits), which is an integral part of the program, can be taken for six months or can be stretched out over twelve months. It not only provides students with technical skills, but also social skills in project management and teamwork.5. Master’s Thesis (30 ECTS credits):With your thesis, you demonstrate that you have the necessary skills and abilities to independently work on a subject-specific problem using scientific methods.\\xa0Team projects, seminars and thesis topics are offered by the individual chairs of the School of Business Informatics and Mathematics and the Business School. Students can discuss current topics of business informatics in practical application or in research.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCourse schedules\\n\\t\\t\\tM.Sc Business Informatics course schedule HWS 23\\n\\nExamination regulations and module catalogThe module catalog 2023/2024 (and Appendix) gives an overview of the courses and contents of the program.Please read the examination regulations for your program carefully.\\n\\nExamination committeeChairmanProf. Dr. Rainer GemullaLehr\\xadstuhl für Praktische Informatik I: Data Analytics\\n    Universität Mannheim\\n    \\n        Fakultät für Wirtschafts\\xadinformatik und Wirtschafts\\xadmathematik\\n    \\n    \\n        B 6, 26 – Raum B 0.16\\n    \\n    \\n    \\n        68159 Mannheim\\n    \\n    \\n    \\nTel.:\\xa0+49 621 181-2480E-Mail: rgemulla uni-mannheim.deWeb: www.uni-mannheim.de/dws/people/professors/prof-dr-rainer-gemullaFoto: Leonie KopetzkiStudent representative: Michael TimpelanYou can contact the examination committee via pruefungsausschuss.wim uni-mannheim.de\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Tasks of the central examination committeeWe are responsible for the following topics :Advice on examination regulationsAdvice on module changesAdvice in individual cases (such as extension of deadlines)Approval of reasons for withdrawal or delayExtension of examination deadlinesSerious cases of cheating and breaches of regulationsDetermination of definitive failure with no option to re-sitIdentification of missed deadlinesInvalidity of examinationsAppeal procedureRecognition of coursework and examinationsSemester recognition certificates for BAföG, form 5 according to § 48 BAföG (also for LAG WPO)For further general information regarding the Master in Business Informatics contact:Birgit Czanderle, M.A.Studien\\xaderfolgskoordinatorin, Studien\\xadcoaching Wirtschafts\\xadinformatik und MMDS, Kontaktstelle zum Prüfungs\\xadausschuss\\n    Universität Mannheim\\n    \\n        Fakultät für Wirtschafts\\xadinformatik und Wirtschafts\\xadmathematik\\n    \\n    \\n        B 6, 26\\n    \\n    \\n        Gebäudeteil B – Raum B 0.05\\n    \\n    \\n        68159 Mannheim\\n    \\n    \\n    \\nTel.:\\xa0+49 621 181-2468E-Mail: czanderle uni-mannheim.deSprechstunde:nach VereinbarungFoto: Emilie Orgler\\n\\nAdvisory serviceThe student advisory (run by the study coach and program manager) is a combined offer for the master's program in Business Informatics.You can consult us in questions regarding:the study programthe module catalogthe examination regulationscases of hardshipquestions about module changescontents of coursesyour degree plan (modules, tracks, thesis)You can contact the advisory service via studienberatung.wim uni-mannheim.de. \\xa0\\xa0Birgit Czanderle, M.A.Studien\\xaderfolgskoordinatorin, Studien\\xadcoaching Wirtschafts\\xadinformatik und MMDS, Kontaktstelle zum Prüfungs\\xadausschuss\\n    Universität Mannheim\\n    \\n        Fakultät für Wirtschafts\\xadinformatik und Wirtschafts\\xadmathematik\\n    \\n    \\n        B 6, 26\\n    \\n    \\n        Gebäudeteil B – Raum B 0.05\\n    \\n    \\n        68159 Mannheim\\n    \\n    \\n    \\nTel.:\\xa0+49 621 181-2468E-Mail: czanderle uni-mannheim.deSprechstunde:nach VereinbarungFoto: Emilie OrglerLisa Wessa, M.A.Studien\\xadgangs\\xadmanagement B.Sc.

It is primarily your responsibility as a student to contact a chair that fits your study profile. This means that you need to contact several chairs or professors on your own initiative in order to find someone who will agree to supervise your thesis. It is the norm that students contact the chairs personally, and something we expect from students at our school.\\xa0Master’s students of Business Informatics may write their thesis either in the field of business informatics or informatics.
