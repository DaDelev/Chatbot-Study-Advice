       "0   Yes, you can change modules if you are a student enrolled before the fall semester 2018. To request a module change, you need to submit a written request to the examination committee, including your address, student ID number, and email address. Unsuccessful examination attempts will be transferred from the original module to the new module. However, it is important to note that a module change does not affect the requirements defined in the examination regulations, and the original module registration remains until the end of the exam registration period. If you are still registered for the original module after the exam registration period, you should contact Student Services I (General2023 chunk 2).  \n",

The examiner determines the topic, the minimum and maximum number of participants, the duration of the project, and the weighting of the components for calculating the examination grade. Once assigned to a project, you are admitted to the examination.
